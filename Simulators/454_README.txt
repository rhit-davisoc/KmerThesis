DESCRIPTION:

	ART (art_454 version 1.2.5) is a simulation program to generate sequence read data of Roche 454
      	Pyrosequencing sequencers. ART generates reads according to the empirical read quality profile
       	and the calibrated error profile of uncall/overcall homopolymers from real 454 read data. ART 
	has been using for testing or benchmarking a variety of method or tools for next-generation 
	sequencing data analysis, including read alignment, de novo assembly, detection of SNP, CNV, or
       	other structure variation.
       	
COMPILATION AND INSTALLATION:

	./configure --prefix=$HOME
	make
	make install

EXAMPLES

	In the "examples" subdirectory, the shell script "run_test_examples.sh" gives two examples of using
       	art_454 for read simulation.  To test these two examples, just run the script "run_test_examples.sh"
USAGE

       SINGLE-END READ SIMULATION

          art_454 [ -p read_profile ] <INPUT_SEQ_FILE> <OUTPUT_FILE_PREFIX> <FOLD_COVERAGE>

          Example:
              art_454 seq_reference.fa ./outdir/dat_single_end 20

       PAIRED-END READ SIMULATION

          art_454 [ -p read_profile ] <INPUT_SEQ_FILE> <OUTPUT_FILE_PREFIX> <FOLD_COVERAGE> <MEAN_FRAG_LEN> <STD_DEV>

          Example:
             art_454 seq_reference.fa ./outdir/dat_paired_end 20 500 20

      COMMAND-LINE PARAMETERS

          INPUT_SEQ_FILE     -  the filename of DNA reference sequences in FASTA format
          OUTPUT_FILE_PREFIX -  the prefix or directory of output read data file (*.fq) and read alignment file (*.aln)
	  FOLD_COVERAGE      -  the fold of read coverage over the reference sequences 
	  MEAN_FRAG_LEN      -  the average DNA fragment size for paired-end read simulation 
	  STD_DEV            -  the standard deviation of the DNA fragment size for paired-end read simulation 

      OPTIONAL PARAMETERS 
      
         -p specify user's own read profile for simulation 
	 
	    the name of a read profile is the filename of directory containing read profile data files. a read profile
	    should consist of the four following files:  

	    1) qual_1st_profile   - empirical quality distribution of the 1st base of DNA homopolymers 
                                    These are homopolymer-length dependent distributions (one distribution for each length of homopolymer)
	    2) qual_mc_profile    - Markov Chain-based empirical quality distribution of the remaining bases of DNA homopolymers 
	    3) indel_erro_profile - undercall or overcall error profiles of DNA homopolymers 
	    4) length_dist        - the empirical distribution of 454 read length 

	    Please see the real example the under the folder "454_FLX_profile" for file formats of these four files. 

OUTPUT FILES

	*.fq   - FASTQ read data files. For paired-end read simulation, *1.fq contains data of the first reads, and *2.fq for the second reads.
	*.aln  - read alignment files. For paired-end read simulation, *1.aln has read alignments for the first reads and *2.aln for the second reads.
	*.stat - read coverage files with the following three tab-delimited fields per lines: 
		 (1)reference position  
		 (2)number of reads starting at the position  
		 (3)number of reads covering the position  

	FASTQ FILE format 
		A FASTQ file contains both sequence bases and quality scores of sequencing reads and is in the following format:  
			@read_id 
			sequence_read 
			+ 
			base_quality_scores 
	
		A base quality score is coded by the ASCII code of a single character, where the quality score is equal to ASCII code of the
       		character minus 33.    

		Example: 
		@refid-4028550-1 
		caacgccactcagcaatgatcggtttattcacgat...
		+ 
		????????????7?????<??>??=&?<<?-<?0?...

	ALN format 
		>ref_seq_id	read_id	aln_start_pos	ref_seq_strand
	       	ref_seq_aligned
	       	read_seq_aligned 
	
		aln_start_pos is the alignment start position of reference sequence. aln_start_pos is always relative to the strand of reference
       		sequence. That is, aln_start_pos 10 in the plus (+) strand is different from aln_start_pos 10 in the minus (‚Äê) stand.  
	
		ref_seq_aligned is the aligned region of reference sequence, which can be from plus strand or minus strand of the reference sequence.  
		read_seq_aligned is the aligned sequence read, which always in the same orientation of the same read in the corresponding fastq file.
